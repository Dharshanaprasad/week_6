# Reflection

## What did you learn from this practical?

- I learned how to create and use classes in Python, including methods like `__init__`, `__str__`, and custom methods.

## What did you find challenging?

- Understanding how to properly initialize and use class attributes was challenging at first.

## How did you overcome these challenges?

- I overcame these challenges by carefully studying examples, asking questions, and practicing writing code.

## What would you do differently next time?

- Next time I would start by writing out a plan for my classes and methods to ensure I understand their structure before coding.

## How will you use this in the future?

- I will use these skills to organize and manage more complex data in my future projects, making my code cleaner and easier to maintain.
